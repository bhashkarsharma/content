Having completed 25 years on this planet, I suddenly feel old :P and no longer a teenager (looks like it took me a while to get out of that one).<span class="more"></span>

Wanted to share a couple of things I have learnt (forgive me if something doesn't fit, I'm still learning).

Here goes, in no particular order. _[Warning: Slur of clichés coming up]_

- Love yourself
- Happiness is internal, and you are in full control of your own
- Do what you [really enjoy doing](http://danshipper.com/love-is-right-in-front-of-you)
- Books are the best things on the planet
- Attitude matters a lot
- Never miss a good chance to shut up
- However solidly founded an institution might be, it generally begins to slack once its size exceeds a certain threshold
- Chocolates are delicious
- Some people are hard on the outside, but have a good heart. Others are sweet from the outside, but only because they something. Some are just jerks. A few might be like Ferrero Rocher, though. Hold on to the gems</li>
- Not everyone is meant to be a part of your life forever. Some people come as teachers, and leave once their job is done
- 'Always' and 'never' are two words you should always remember never to use
- Have fun. Enjoy today. Be happy. I know all of them are clichés but they are that way for a reason
- Most people do things not because they think it is the right thing to do, but because it makes them feel 'at ease'
- There are only two things in life: gifts and lessons
- The best route to real happiness is gratefulness
- Always be open to possibilities
- Making mistakes is okay, as long as you continue to learn from them
- There are [some things](http://www.quora.com/Being-Wealthy/What-are-some-things-that-money-cant-buy) money can't buythose it can, mostly the effect [doesn't last](http://www.quora.com/Wealthy-People-and-Families/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-a-self-made-millionaire-under-the-age-of-25)
- Its amazing how much we can learn; and fascinating how much we fail to
- Never stop dreaming
- Experiences become memories and that's all what remains in the end
- Destinations keep changing. It's enjoying the journey that matters
- Atention to details is important ;)
- Sharing a very good [lesson](http://danshipper.com/159185755) I learnt this morning
- Keep asking "[Why?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VdO7LuoBzM)"

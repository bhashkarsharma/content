Generative AI is taking over the world. As time passes, more and more products and technologies will connect with generative AI. In addition, large language models are becoming multi model which means they can deal with more than just text. Now they can input an out audio video Speech, text images and so on which means they have access to information about more parts or aspects of the world is going to be very interesting. How this changes the world, but it has potential to massively transform how we will be living in just a couple of years. 

A lot has been said speculated and wondered about the impact of AI on our society and future. I’m not here to speculate about that.

I’m thinking of writing about something different, which is how AI generate AI as it involves, teaching us, more about ourselves, the nature of intelligence, and how are biggest of achievements or things that we consider the most valuable or hardest things to do might actually end up being the skills and abilities that get automated first Which would not only leave millions of billions of people lacking for a job, but more importantly, it will making us confront with our own reality 

Example, mental and memory skills have had high regard value in society for very long time because those girls have go ahead in allowing us to be productive and to be contributing towards economic growth essentially making us useful members of society and capitalism. Tying us with the value with basically What we could produce for the markets but now in the new world that we live in where most of a lot of work the highly paid people are supposed to do starts getting automated. We are gonna have a reckoning with how or what happens from here.
